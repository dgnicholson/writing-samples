## How to play tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player strategy game that can be played in just a few minutes with a pen and paper. 

### Set up
A game of tic-tac-toe is set up by first drawing a 3x3 grid. Next, each player must choose either the `X` character or the `O` character. 

> **TIP**: If players can't decide who gets to be what character, try flipping a coin.

### Gameplay
Player `X` always goes first and draws their character inside any cell in the 3x3 grid. Players then alternate turns until there is a winner or the grid is fullâ€”whichever comes first. 

### Objective
To win a game of tic-tac-toe, a player needs to draw three of their chosen character in a continuous line across the 3x3 grid. This line can appear horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In the following example, `X` has won the game because they have a diagonal line. 

|  X |  O |   |
|---|---|---|
|   | **X** |   |
|   | **O** | **X** |

If no player has been able to create a continuous line and the grid is full, the game is a draw.
