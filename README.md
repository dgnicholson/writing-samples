  } else {
  int[] countArray = new int[needles.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < needles.length; i++) {
  String[] words = haystack.split("[ \"\'\t\n\b\f\r]", 0);    
    for (int j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
  if (words[j].compareTo(needles[i]) == 0) {
    countArray[i]++;
      }
    }
  }
for (int j = 0; j < needles.length; j++) {
System.out.println(needles[j] + ": " + countArray[j]);
      }
    }
}
```
The audience is an experienced Java programmer.
